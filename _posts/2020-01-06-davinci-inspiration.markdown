We learn about so many  great people, usually what they achieved and ofcourse, the difference they made. 

Few instances, nowadays many instances, we learn also the struggle. For me, the most interesting or the fascinating part has been the passion that led to the struggle and the great things.

Recently I have been to Lourve DaVinci exhibit. The gifted artist and the diving paintings! My favorite part(_Ah! So American no 'u'_) was his journal exhibit. We see his notes on obesrvations of birds, human body and his rough sketches. He practiced before painting. I mean one could think ofcourse, duh!!

He practiced many times which I am assuming till he is satisfied with his understanding of the lines. He was obviously gifted with genius during birth. I think his passion, willingness to practice and learn was his gift. Everyone can do that at the minimum, practice what you are good at and want to be good at. Try to become better. In this times so much of the knowledge is free. We can self tech and become better. _Practice and learning would be the two things I am going to do this year_
